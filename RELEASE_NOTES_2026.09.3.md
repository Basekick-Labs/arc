## Bug fixes

### A pull that crashed one step before the rename left a file that read as present and was never finalised ([#963](https://github.com/Basekick-Labs/arc/issues/963))

On a per-node-storage cluster, the file puller writes each incoming file to a
`.part` staging file and renames it into place once the last byte and the
checksum are in. Its "already here" test asked the local backend for the
file's size and compared it with the manifest's, and the backend answered with
the staging file's size when the final file was absent, so that an interrupted
download could resume where it stopped. A crash or a kill in the one step
between the last byte and the rename left a staging file of exactly the
manifest's size and no final file. From then on the test said "present": the
worker skipped the pull, the catch-up walks skipped it, nothing renamed it,
and queries on that node, which read `*.parquet`, returned fewer rows with no
error. The storage listing hides staging files, so reconciliation never saw it
either.

Presence now requires the final file. When the backend reports a staged
partial for a path, the puller confirms the final file exists before it calls
the path present; without it the entry is pulled again, and the fresh pull
truncates the stale staging file and renames the result into place. Resuming
a short partial is unchanged, and the S3 and Azure backends, which have no
staging files, are unaffected.
